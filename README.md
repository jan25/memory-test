# Memory test - Chimp vs Human

How well can you remember a random layout of numbers? Try this game to test your short term memory skills. In this game you are presented with random layout of numbers from 1 through 9, your goal is to remember them and recall them when they're hidden from you.

Try it here - [memory-test/game](jan25.github.io/memory-test/build)

## Motivation

Did you know a Chimpanzee can remember a random layout of numbers 1-9, such as in this game, correctly better than humans? Watch this video to see a chimp in action: [Chimp vs Human! | Memory Test | BBC Earth
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A)

I tried to replicate the test from above video in a web page, and this simple react project is the result of it.
